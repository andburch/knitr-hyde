This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

<p class = "figcaption">Here is a plot for you.</p>

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

You can do math, too:  inline math is like this:  $$ \pi/2 \approx 1.57 $$ and displayed math as well:

$$ \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}.$$

How lovely.
